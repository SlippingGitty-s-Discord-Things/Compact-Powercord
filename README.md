<p align="center">Powercord Products, but more compact.</p>

In my most ambitious project yet, I have decided to crack open my finest wine, shower in my most delicious smelling shampoo and conditioner, take out my dry-cleaned tuxedo I keep in the back of my closet, and create something truly wonderful. Something so spectacular that you would think God himself came from above and granted me a beautiful vision that would allow me the knowledge to create something truly tremendous.

## Info ‚ÑπÔ∏è

Despite Powercord being one of the better competing Discord modifications, I find myself getting increasingly annoyed at how much fodder there is in it's UI. I will continue to tweak what I have here and there, but yeah. This was not a project of love, and is mostly just an overdone shitpost. Feel free to throw this in your themes. I don't expect credit for dicking around with padding and margins. This is licensed under WTFPL.
