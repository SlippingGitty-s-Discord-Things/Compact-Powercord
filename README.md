## Info ‚ÑπÔ∏è

I find myself getting increasingly annoyed at how much fodder there is in Powercord's UI, so.. this is the result. I will continue to tweak what I have here and there, but yeah. This was not made with much love at all

Feel free to throw this in your themes. I don't expect credit for dicking around with padding and margins. This is licensed under WTFPL. 

## How to use üìñ 
Open a terminal in the Powercord themes folder, and type `git clone https://github.com/SlippingGitty/Compact-Powercord`.


## Trailer üé• 

In my most ambitious project yet, I have decided to crack open my finest wine, shower in my most delicious smelling shampoo and conditioner, take out my dry-cleaned tuxedo I keep in the back of my closet, and create something truly wonderful. Something so spectacular that you would think God himself came from above and granted me a beautiful vision that would allow me the knowledge to create something truly tremendous.

Truly one of the most innovative things ever designed since Slate.
